# Workflow Phases

## Phase 1: Plan

Goal: classify the request, get task-creation consent, produce planning artifacts.

### Steps

| Step | Name | Required | Output |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| 1.0 | Create task | required · once | `task.json` |
| 1.1 | Requirement exploration | required · repeatable | `prd.md` |
| 1.2 | Grill PRD | required L3-L5 · optional L2 | `research/grill-me.md` |
| 1.3 | Technical design | conditional · once | `design.md` (L3 optional, L4/L5 required) |
| 1.4 | Execution planning | required · once | minimal `implement.md` for L2; Review Gate Contract for L3-L5 |
| 1.5 | Research | optional · repeatable | `research/*.md` |
| 1.6 | Configure context | required L3-L5 · optional L2 | `implement.jsonl` + `check.jsonl` |
| 1.7 | Implementation approval | required · once | User explicitly approves |
| 1.8 | Activate task | required · once | `task.py start` |

### Gates

- No task creation consent → no `task.py create`
- No implementation consent → no `task.py start`, no source editing
- L4/L5 missing `design.md` → no `task.py start`

---

## Phase 2: Execute

Goal: turn planning artifacts into code that passes quality checks and review gates.

### Steps

| Step | Name | Required | Output |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| 2.0 | Before-dev | required · once | Constraint checklist |
| 2.1 | Implement | required · repeatable | Changed files |
| 2.2 | Quality check | required · repeatable | PASS/FAIL |
| 2.3 | Review gates | required · repeatable | Each review PASS/FAIL |
| 2.4 | Rollback | on demand | Return to correct state |

### Gates

- No task artifacts read → no source editing
- check FAIL → return to implement
- review gate FAIL → return to implement
- Cannot skip any selected gate

---

## Phase 3: Finish

Goal: ensure quality, capture lessons, record work.

### Steps

| Step | Name | Required | Output |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| 3.0 | Finish consent | required · once | User explicitly enters Finish |
| 3.1 | Finish evidence | required · once | Finish Approval + Spec Update Decision + Observable Outcomes + Delivery Sync Check in `finish.md` |
| 3.2 | Commit changes | required · once | git commits |
| 3.3 | Merge review | conditional · once | `review/merge-review.md` |
| 3.4 | Validation | required · once | `validation/test-results.md` |
| 3.5 | Finish work | required · once | archive + journal |
| 3.6 | Debug retrospective | on demand | `research/break-loop.md` |

### Gates

- No explicit Finish consent → no `finish.md`, no spec update, no commit, no archive

### Finish-Work Preconditions

1. Implementation complete
2. `trellis-check` PASS
3. Selected review gates PASS
4. Finish Approval recorded
5. Spec Update Decision recorded
6. Observable Outcomes recorded with evidence
7. Delivery Sync Check recorded
8. Merge review PASS when required
9. Code committed, PR created, or explicitly no commit needed
10. Build/test PASS or explicitly recorded as not executable
